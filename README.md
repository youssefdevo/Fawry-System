## Design Principles and Patterns

### Object-Oriented Design Principles

- **Encapsulation:** Ensures data protection and abstraction of payment details.
- **Polymorphism:** Supports multiple payment methods using a common interface.
- **Inheritance:** Extends payment functionalities for different providers.

### Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern:** Manages the creation of service provider instances.
- **Observer Pattern:** Notifies users of updates like successful transactions or promotions.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Dynamically selects payment methods at runtime.
- **Decorator Pattern:** Applies discounts or promotions to transactions.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a single instance of critical classes like database connections.
